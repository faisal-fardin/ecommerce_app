# Introduction This App
## Splash Screen
The splash screen is typically the first screen that users see when they launch the app. It often displays the app's logo or a brief loading animation and serves as an introductory screen before the main application loads.
## Home Screen
The home screen is the central hub of the app where users can access various features and navigate to different sections of the application. It usually provides an overview of the app's main content and functionality.
## Product Details Screen
This screen displays detailed information about a specific product, including its name, description, price, images, and user reviews. Users can typically view product details and make purchase decisions on this screen.
## Login Screen & ## OTP Verify Screen
The login screen is where users can enter their credentials (e.g., username and password) to access their accounts or specific features of the app. It's a crucial component for apps that require user authentication.

This screen is typically used for one-time password (OTP) verification, often sent to a user's mobile number or email during the registration or login process. Users enter the OTP here to verify their identity.
## Loading Screen
A loading screen appears when the app is retrieving data or performing time-consuming tasks. It informs users that the app is working in the background and provides a visual indication of progress.
## Cart Screen 
This screen is typically used for one-time password (OTP) verification, often sent to a user's mobile number or email during the registration or login process. Users enter the OTP here to verify their identity.
## Wish List & ## Categories List
Users can add products they are interested in but not ready to purchase to their wish list. This screen allows users to manage and view their saved items for future reference.

This screen provides a list of product categories or sections within the app, making it easier for users to browse and filter products based on their interests.

## Complete Profile Screen
Users can update and manage their profile information, including personal details, shipping addresses, and notification preferences on this screen.
